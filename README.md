# BIP Poznań: QRW Search Algorithm

## About this project
The project concerns the final presentation of the **BIP** (Blended Intensive Program) in Poznań, Poland, for Erasmus+ by the University of Padova.

### Project
A Quantum Random Walk search algorithm is implemented on an n-dimensional hypercube, as initially described by [Shenvi et alter](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0210064) in their work. Multiple implementations are provided in Qiskit, first as a unitary operator, and subsequently decomposed into more concise two-level unitary gates. Lastly, the transformation of the Quantum Random Walk circuit output into a grid is achieved, drawing inspiration from Cellular Automata.
