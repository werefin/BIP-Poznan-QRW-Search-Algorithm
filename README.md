# BIP Poznań: QRW Search Algorithm

## About this project
This project pertains to the concluding phase of the **BIP** (Blended Intensive Program) in Poznań (Poland) which is part of the Erasmus+ mobility program jointly organized by the University of Padova (UniPD) and the University of Adam Mickiewicz (AMU) in Poznań.

The initial steps were taken in implementing the first instances of the Quantum Random Walk (QRW) concerning the [QiSkit tutorial](https://learn.qiskit.org/course/ch-algorithms/quantum-walk-search-algorithm).

Then, a Quantum Random Walk search algorithm was implemented on an n-dimensional hypercube, as initially described by [Shenvi et alter](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0210064) in their work. Multiple implementations were provided in Qiskit, first as a unitary operator, and subsequently decomposed into more concise two-level unitary gates. Subsequently, the results of a real execution on IBMQ quantum computers were reported. Lastly, the transformation of the Quantum Random Walk circuit output into a grid was achieved, drawing inspiration from Cellular Automata.
